# 🧩 Coinvert — Browse the Web in SOL

**Coinvert** is a lightweight Chrome extension that replaces fiat currency prices on websites — such as $, £, €, ₹, and more — with real-time **Solana (◎)** equivalents using live exchange rates.

> _“It’s always cheaper in Solana.”_

## 🔍 What It Does

- 💸 Converts all visible prices (USD, GBP, EUR, INR, etc.) to SOL equivalents  
- 🧠 Lets you hover to see the original price (optional)  
- 🌙 Includes dark mode and user settings  
- 🔐 Fully local, no data collection or tracking  
- 🧾 Free forever, open-source, and privacy-first

---

## 🖥 How It Works

Coinvert scans visible webpage text for recognizable fiat price formats and replaces them with a live conversion to Solana (◎), using CoinGecko as the price source.

It runs entirely within your browser and requires no wallet, login, or account.
